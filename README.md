# Penguin Project
This project explores the concept of reproducible data in research publications. With the the penguin dataset from the package 'palmerpenguins', I used a data pipeline to ensure my analysis and code is reproducible. Therefore, others using my code can use my code and results can be recreated independently. 

Refer to and run the code in question 2 of the R markdown file present in the folder. This consists of the data pipeline to clean, create hypotheses, statistically analyse, plot results figures and make conclusions from my data
