# Penguin Project

This project explores the concept of reproducible data in scientific research publications. With the penguin dataset from the package 'palmerpenguins', I implemented a data pipeline to ensure the reproducibility of my analysis and code. Using this pipeline, others using my code can recreate the same results independently. 

To review the data pipeline I created, refer to and run the code in question 2 of the R markdown file present in the folder. This consists of the entire data pipeline, including the code for data cleaning, my hypotheses, statistical analysis, figure plotting, and my conclusions from the dataset.

If the functions are required, the cleaning function to clean the data is stored in 'functions' in the data folder.

The plotting function to visualise the results figures is stored in 'functions' within the figures folder.
